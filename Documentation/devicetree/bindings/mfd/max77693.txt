Maxim MAX77693 multi-function device

MAX77693 is a Multifunction device with the following submodules:
- PMIC,
- CHARGER,
- LED,
- MUIC,
- HAPTIC

It is interfaced to host controller using i2c.
This document describes the bindings for the mfd device.

Required properties:
- compatible : Must be "maxim,max77693".
- reg : Specifies the i2c slave address of PMIC block.
- interrupts : This i2c device has an IRQ line connected to the main SoC.
- interrupt-parent :  The parent interrupt controller.

Optional properties:
- regulators : The regulators of max77693 have to be instantiated under subnod
  named "regulators" using the following format.

	regulators {
		regualtor-compatible = ESAFEOUT1/ESAFEOUT2/CHARGER
		standard regulator constratints[*].
	};

	[*] refer Documentation/devicetree/bindings/regulator/regulator.txt

Optional node:
- led-flash : the LED submodule device node

Required properties of "led-flash" node:
- compatible : must be "maxim,max77693-flash"
- maxim,num-leds : number of connected leds
	Possible values: 1 or 2.
- maxim,fleds : array of current outputs in order: fled1, fled2
	Note: both current outputs can be connected to a single led
	Possible values:
		0 - the output is left disconnected,
		1 - a diode is connected to the output.

Optional properties of "led-flash" node:
- maxim,boost-mode :
	In boost mode the device can produce up to 1.2A of total current
	on both outputs. The maximum current on each output is reduced
	to 625mA then. If maxim,num-leds == <2> boost must be enabled
	(it defaults to 1 if not set):
	Possible values:
		0 - no boost,
		1 - adaptive mode,
		2 - fixed mode.
- iout-torch : Array of maximum intensities in microamperes of the torch
	led currents in order: fled1, fled2.
		15625 - 250000
- iout-flash : Array of maximum intensities in microamperes of the flash
	led currents in order: fled1, fled2.
	Range:
		15625 - 1000000 (max 625000 if boost mode is enabled)
- flash-timeout : timeout in microseconds after which flash led
		  is turned off
	Range:
		62500 - 1000000
- maxim,trigger : Array of flags indicating which trigger can activate given led
	in order: fled1, fled2
	Possible flag values (can be combined):
		1 - FLASH pin of the chip,
		2 - TORCH pin of the chip,
		4 - software via I2C command.
- maxim,trigger-type : Array of trigger types in order: flash, torch.
	Possible trigger types:
		0 - Rising edge of the signal triggers the flash/torch,
		1 - Signal level controls duration of the flash/torch.
- maxim,boost-vout : Output voltage of the boost module in millivolts.
- maxim,vsys-min : Low input voltage level in millivolts. Flash is not fired
	if chip estimates that system voltage could drop below this level due
	to flash power consumption.

Example:
	max77693@66 {
		compatible = "maxim,max77693";
		reg = <0x66>;
		interrupt-parent = <&gpx1>;
		interrupts = <5 2>;

		regulators {
			esafeout@1 {
				regulator-compatible = "ESAFEOUT1";
				regulator-name = "ESAFEOUT1";
				regulator-boot-on;
			};
			esafeout@2 {
				regulator-compatible = "ESAFEOUT2";
				regulator-name = "ESAFEOUT2";
				};
			charger@0 {
				regulator-compatible = "CHARGER";
				regulator-name = "CHARGER";
				regulator-min-microamp = <60000>;
				regulator-max-microamp = <2580000>;
					regulator-boot-on;
			};
		};
		led_flash: led-flash {
			compatible = "maxim,max77693-flash";
			iout-torch = <500000 0>;
			iout-flash = <1250000 0>;
			flash-timeout = <1000000 1000000>;
			maxim,num-leds = <1>;
			maxim,fleds = <1 1>;
			maxim,trigger = <7 7>;
			maxim,trigger-type = <0 1>;
			maxim,boost-mode = <1>;
