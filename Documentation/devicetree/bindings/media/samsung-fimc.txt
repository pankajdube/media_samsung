Samsung S5P/EXYNOS SoC Camera Subsystem (FIMC)
----------------------------------------------

The S5P/Exynos SoC Camera subsystem comprises of multiple sub-devices
represented by separate device tree nodes. Currently this includes: FIMC (in
the S5P SoCs series known as CAMIF), MIPI CSIS, FIMC-LITE and FIMC-IS (ISP).

The sub-subdevices are defined as child nodes of the common 'camera' node which
also includes common properties of the whole subsystem not really specific to
any single sub-device, like common camera port pins or the CAMCLK clock outputs
for external image sensors attached to an SoC.

Common 'camera' node
--------------------

Required properties:

- compatible : must be "samsung,fimc", "simple-bus"

The 'camera' node must include at least one 'fimc' child node.


'fimc' device nodes
-------------------

Required properties:

- compatible : "samsung,s5pv210-fimc" for S5PV210, "samsung,exynos4210-fimc"
  for Exynos4210 and "samsung,exynos4212-fimc" for Exynos4x12 SoCs;
- reg : physical base address and size of the device  memory mapped registers;
- interrupts : FIMC interrupt to the CPU should be described here;
- samsung,pix-limits : an array of supported image sizes in pixels, for details
  refer to Table 2-1 in the S5PV210 SoC User Manual.

For every fimc node a numbered alias should be present in the aliases node.
Aliases are of the form fimc<n>, where <n> is an integer (0...N) specifying
the IP's instance index.

Optional properties:

- clock-frequency : maximum FIMC local clock (LCLK) frequency;
- samsung,min-pix-sizes : an array specyfing minimum image size in pixels at
  the FIMC input and output DMA, in the first and second cell respectively.
  Default value when this property is not present is <16 16>;
- samsung,min-pix-alignment : minimum supported image height alignment (first
  cell) and the horizontal image offset (second cell). The values are in pixels
  and default to <2 1> when this property is not present;
- samsung,mainscaler-ext : a boolean property indicating whether the FIMC IP
  supports extended image size and has CIEXTEN register;
- samsung,rotators : a bitmask specifying whether this IP has the input and
  the output rotator. Bits 4 and 0 correspond to input and output rotator
  respectively. If a rotator is present its corresponding bit should be set.
  Default value when this property is not specified is 0x11.
- samsung,cam-if : a bolean property indicating whether the IP block includes
  the camera input interface.
- samsung,isp-wb : this property must be present if the IP block has the ISP
  writeback input.


Example:

	aliases {
		fimc0 = &fimc_0;
	};

	camera {
		compatible = "samsung,fimc", "simple-bus";
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <1>;
		status = "okay";

		fimc_0: fimc@11800000 {
			compatible = "samsung,exynos4210-fimc";
			reg = <0x11800000 0x1000>;
			interrupts = <0 85 0>;
			status = "okay";
		};

		csis_0: csis@11880000 {
			compatible = "samsung,exynos4210-csis";
			reg = <0x11880000 0x1000>;
			interrupts = <0 78 0>;
		};
	};
