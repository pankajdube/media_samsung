Samsung S5P/EXYNOS SoC Camera Subsystem (FIMC)
----------------------------------------------

The Exynos Camera subsystem comprises of multiple sub-devices that are
represented by separate platform devices. Some of the IPs come in different
variants across the SoC revisions (FIMC) and some remain mostly unchanged
(MIPI CSIS, FIMC-LITE).

All those sub-subdevices are defined as parent nodes of the common device
node, which also includes common properties of the whole subsystem not really
specific to any single sub-device, like common camera port pins or external
clocks for image sensors attached to the SoC.

Common 'camera' node
--------------------

Required properties:

- compatible	   : must be "samsung,fimc", "simple-bus"

The 'camera' node must include at least one 'fimc' child node.


'fimc' device nodes
-------------------

Required properties:

- compatible : "samsung,s5pv210-fimc" for S5PV210,
	       "samsung,exynos4210-fimc" for Exynos4210,
	       "samsung,exynos4212-fimc" for Exynos4212/4412 SoCs;
- reg	     : physical base address and size of the device memory mapped
	       registers;
- interrupts : FIMC interrupt to the CPU should be described here;

For every fimc node a numbered alias should be present in the aliases node.
Aliases are of the form fimc<n>, where <n> is an integer (0...N) specifying
the IP's instance index.

Optional properties

 - clock-frequency - maximum FIMC local clock (LCLK) frequency

Example:

	aliases {
		csis0 = &csis_0;
		fimc0 = &fimc_0;
	};

	camera {
		compatible = "samsung,fimc", "simple-bus";
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <1>;
		status = "okay";

		fimc_0: fimc@11800000 {
			compatible = "samsung,exynos4210-fimc";
			reg = <0x11800000 0x1000>;
			interrupts = <0 85 0>;
			status = "okay";
		};

		csis_0: csis@11880000 {
			compatible = "samsung,exynos4210-csis";
			reg = <0x11880000 0x1000>;
			interrupts = <0 78 0>;
			max-data-lanes = <4>;
		};
	};
