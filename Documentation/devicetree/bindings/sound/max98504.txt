Maxim MAX98504 class D mono speaker amplifier

This device supports I2C control interface and an IRQ output signal. It features
a PCM and PDM digital audio interface (DAI) and a differential analog input.

Required properties:

 - compatible : "maxim,max98504"
 - reg : should contain the I2C slave device address
 - DVDD-supply, DIOVDD-supply, PVDD-supply: power supplies for the device,
   as covered in ../regulator/regulator.txt
 - interrupts : should specify the interrupt the device is connected to,
   as described in ../interrupt-controller/interrupts.txt

Example:

 max98504@31 {
	compatible = "maxim,max98504";
	reg = <0x31>;
	interrupt-parent = <&gpio_bank_0>;
	interrupts = <2 0>;

	DVDD-supply = <&regulator>;
	DIOVDD-supply = <&regulator>;
	PVDD-supply = <&regulator>;
};
